      <description>&lt;p&gt;Byron is a PhD student in the Department of Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences. He was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. He moved to New York City to study psychology, where he received a BA in Psychology from St. Johnâ€™s University (2015) and then a MA in Behavioral Neuroscience from Queens College (2017). Byron worked as a Research Operations Manager at a start-up company that develops assistive products for blind and low vision individuals (2017 - 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byron&amp;rsquo;s main research interest is studying how image processing and psychophysics can be used to understand how low vision conditions affect visual tasks. Specifically, how combining computational models with simulated low vision impairment conditions can help inform and enhance individualized vision capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byron is supervised by Dr. Michael Beyeler in the Bionic Vision Lab and Dr. Miguel Eckstein in the Vision and Image Understanding Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lucas Gil Nadolskis is currently a Graduate Student Researcher in the Bionic Vision Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas got his BS in Computer Science with a minor in Neuroscience from the University of Minnesota in 2021, where he performed research related to autonomous navigation, computer vision and brain-computer interfaces. Later, he got his MS in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where his primary work focused on analyzing top-down pathways of the visual system and how this could be integrated into cortical implants for the blind. In addition, he worked with the Human-Computer Interaction department on issues related to accessibility in data visualization, an area that he still seeks to explore in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Fall &amp;lsquo;23, Lucas will be a PhD student in the Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Dynamical Neuroscience (DYNS) at UC Santa Barbara, where he will investigate novel ways to approach cortical implants for the blind. Being blind himself since the age of five, Lucas&amp;rsquo; interests are broad, ranging from neuroscience to accessibility, but can be summarized as efforts to improve the lives of blind people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the lab, most of his free time is occupied by music, traveling and searching for audio-described content.&lt;/p&gt;
