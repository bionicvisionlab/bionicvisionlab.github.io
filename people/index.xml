&lt;p&gt;He is interested in applying machine learning models and computer vision to biological and biomedical applications.
In particular, his research focuses on determining how the mouse brain extracts relevant visual features from the rich, dynamic visual input that typifies active exploration, and to investigate how the neural representations of these features can support visual navigation.
For this, he is performing data-driven statistical analyses and developing (deep) predictive models of brain activity based on visual input and several behavioral variables.&lt;/p&gt;
