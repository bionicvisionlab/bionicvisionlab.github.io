      <title>Greedy optimization of electrode arrangement for epiretinal prostheses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The work of Ashley Bruce, CS&amp;rsquo;s Outstanding MS Student of the Year awardee, was highlighted in MICCAI Daily magazine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current epiretinal implants arrange their electrodes on a rectangular grid.
&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some people have looked at where to place the whole implant on the retina&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;, says Prof. Beyeler. &lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ashley was the first to ask, what if we moved every individual electrode around
based on what we know about how these electrodes produce artificial vision?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, moving every electrode presents the problem of
combinatorial explosion. Even in current devices with only 60
electrodes, there are many possibilities for arranging them. It is not
usually technically feasible to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ashley approached this as a greedy optimization problem, where one
electrode is placed after another&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;, explains Prof. Beyeler.
&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;We used a
computational model of bionic vision to help predict what the vision
would look like for a given electrode placement. By iterating over that,
Ashley found a mathematically proven optimal solution.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A neural autoencoder to enhance sensory neuroprostheses</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2022-06-techxplore/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the required stimulus to produce a desired percept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our latest work on deep learning-based stimulus optimization was featured in a news article by TechXplore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We started working on this project in an attempt to solve the long-standing problem of stimulus optimization in visual prostheses,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bionicvisionlab.org/people/granley_jacob&#34;&gt;Jacob Granley&lt;/a&gt;, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. &amp;ldquo;One of the likely causes for the poor results achieved by visual prostheses is the naive stimulus encoding strategy that devices conventionally use. Previous works have suggested encoding strategies, but many are unrealistic, and none have given a general solution that could work across implants and patients.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are we witnessing the dawn of post-theory science?</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2022-01-guardian/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prof. Beyeler was mentioned in a recent article by The Guardian that discusses recent advances in machine learning and what data-driven discovery means for the classic methodology of hypothesizing, predicting, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A tougher obstacle to the new science may be our human need to explain the world – to talk in terms of cause and effect. In 2019, neuroscientists Bingni Brunton and Michael Beyeler of the University of Washington, Seattle, wrote that this need for interpretability may have prevented scientists from making novel insights about the brain, of the kind that only emerges from large datasets. But they also sympathised. If those insights are to be translated into useful things such as drugs and devices, they wrote, “it is imperative that computational models yield insights that are explainable to, and trusted by, clinicians, end-users and industry”.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prof. Beyeler was part of the Giz Asks series, where the focused turned to the prospect of using brain-machine interface technology to directly write in information to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PCMag: Building the bionic eye... with car tech?</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2021-02-pcmag/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, cyberpunk tales and sci-fi series have featured characters with cybernetic vision—most recently Star Trek Discovery&amp;rsquo;s Lieutenant Keyla Detmer and her ocular implants. In the real world, restoring “natural” vision is still a complex puzzle, though researchers at UC Santa Barbara are developing a smart prosthesis that provides cues to the visually impaired, much like a computer vision system talks to a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, over 10 million people worldwide are living with profound visual impairment, many due to retinal degeneration diseases. Ahead of this week&amp;rsquo;s Augmented Humans International Conference, we spoke with Dr. Michael Beyeler, Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences at UCSB, who is forging ahead with synthetic sight trials at his Bionic Vision Lab and will be presenting a paper at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Beyeler sat down with Luming Cao from SciSection&amp;rsquo;s Human and Science platform to talk about how bionic vision, as sci-fi as it sounds, is already helping to restore vision to the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcript of this informal interview is now available, and a podcast will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UCSB Convergence: Reverse engineering the brain</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2020-05-convergence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 09:29:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2020-05-convergence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Beyeler and the Bionic Vision Lab are featured heavily in the Spring Edition of UCSB&amp;rsquo;s College of Engineering Convergence Magazine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is research to try to understand the brain—how it works on a mechanistic and algorithmic level—and then there&#39;s applying that to an engineered system that can interface with the brain. Brain-computer interfaces can be used both for treating neurological and mental disorders as well as for understanding brain function.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>PCMag: Restoring vision with bionic eyes - no longer science fiction</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2019-07-pcmag/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:29:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bionicvisionlab.org/news/2019-07-pcmag/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new article appeared in PCMag to celebrate the inauguration of the Bionic Vision Lab at UCSB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionic vision might sound like science fiction, but Dr. Michael Beyeler is working on just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally from Switzerland, Dr. Beyeler is wrapping up his postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington before moving to the University of California Santa Barbara this fall to head up the newly formed Bionic Vision Lab in the Departments of Computer Science and Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with him about this &amp;ldquo;deep fascination with the brain&amp;rdquo; and how he hopes his work will eventually be able to restore vision to the blind. Here are edited and condensed excerpts from our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
