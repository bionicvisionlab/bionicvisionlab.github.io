  <div class="row">
    <p>In general, we are looking for enthusiastic, computationally minded individuals with a shared passion for bionic vision.
If you are interested in joining us, make sure we have open positions (see below) and check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit?usp=sharing">Lab Manual</a> to familiarize yourself with our lab culture, policies, and expectations.</p>
<!--
<h3 class="fill-width">Postdoc in Visual/Computational Neuroscience (NeuroAI)</h3>
We are excited to invite a self-driven and enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher to our <a href="/research/mouse-visual-navigation/">VisNav</a> team.
This NeuroAI project, at the exciting crossroads of visual and computational neuroscience, is part of the NIH BRAIN Initiative that seeks to elucidate how the mouse brain processes visual information during active exploration to support visual navigation. Our recent <a href="/publications/2023-12-v1-mouse/">NeurIPS paper</a> highlights how a multimodal recurrent net can integrate gaze-contingent visual input with behavioral and temporal dynamics to explain V1 activity in freely moving mice. We are now seeking to extend this work to higher-order visual areas (HVAs) in collaboration with the labs of Spencer Smith (UCSB), Michael Goard (UCSB), and Cris Niell (University of Oregon).
What we offer:
-	A welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative environment that combines expertise in neuroscience, computer science, and cognitive sciences.
-	A fully funded, unionized position, offering a competitive salary and excellent benefits, for a minimum 2-year commitment.
-	An opportunity to work with diverse experts and engage with unique neural activity data sets, collected using state-of-the-art techniques.
We are looking for:
-	A passionate individual with a solid foundation in visual and computational neuroscience.
-	A PhD in (computational) neuroscience, computer science, cognitive sciences, statistics, or a related field
-	Strong communication and teamwork skills, with proficiency in programming and statistical analysis
To apply, please email your CV and contacts for 2-3 references to <a href="mailto:mbeyeler@ucsb.edu">Michael</a>.
<h3 class="fill-width">Junior RA Positions</h3>
We are currently looking for junior research assistants (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit#heading=h.b7fsq3mt32v0" target="_blank">Junior RAs</a>). As a Junior RA, your responsibilities are three-fold:
- complete readings assigned by the lab manager/your grad student mentor; afterwards, meet with them to discuss
- attend project meetings/training sessions as your schedule allows (no need to attend lab meetings)
- participate in one or more of our ongoing behavioral studies
This is a great way to get introduced to the lab's work and the field of bionic vision.
In the future, this may lead to a Senior RA position where you can contribute more substantially to our research.
Junior RAs typically earn course credit via PSY-99/199 (P/NP or letter grade), CS-196, or your department's equivalent of Directed Research.
For more details, see our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit?usp=sharing">Lab Manual</a>.
If you are interested in becoming a Junior RA, please reach out to our <a href="/people">Lab Manager</a>.

<h3 class="fill-width">All Research Positions</h3>
<p><strong>We are completely full at the moment and for the foreseeable future.</strong> This includes any and all requests for research assistantships and internships&mdash;be it at the post-graduate, MS, undergraduate, or high-school level. Your request may therefore go unanswered.</p>
<p>We do sometimes look for RA help on specific projects (or with specific skillsets). In those cases, we will advertise the position via official university channels (e.g., departmental mailing lists), so keep an eye out for that.</p>

<h3 class="fill-width">PhD Positions for Fall 2024</h3>
We have a limited number of opportunities to join us as a PhD student in Fall 2024. The deadline is December 2023.
We are especially looking for (but not limited to):
1. <a href="https://cs.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">CS</a>/<a href="https://ece.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">ECE</a>: Computer vision (CV) / human-computer interaction (HCI) students interested in <a href="https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/information-needs-blind-low-vision/">assistive technologies</a> and/or <a href="https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/event-based-vision/">Edge AI</a>. You may develop novel scene understanding algorithms, event-based CV systems, and/or prototypes of near-future accessibility aids. Your goal will be to publish at top-tier venues such as CVPR, ASSETS, or CHI.
2. <a href="https://psych.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">PBS</a>: Vision science students interested in working with real <a href="https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/information-needs-blind-low-vision/">low vision</a> and <a href="https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/predicting-visual-outcomes-visual-prostheses/">bionic eye patients</a>. You may run behavioral studies and/or develop computational models to further our understanding of the neural code of vision in health and disease. You don't need a CS background for this, but should have some experience with vision/cognition, psychophysics, and/or clinical populations.
Please apply through the <a href="https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/how-apply/application-and-admission-checklist" target="_blank">Grad Admissions Portal</a>.
You will then be able to indicate your wish to work with us in the "Major and Degree Objective" tab under "Faculty Interests". 
US citizens and permanent residents may apply for a <a href="https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/how-apply/faqs-applicants#Graduate-Fee">fee waiver</a>.
<small><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Please note that we get a lot of emails from prospective PhD students, so Michael will not be able to respond to messages that aren't clearly tailored to the lab's vision, especially if it is apparent that the same "boilerplate" message is being sent to many different labs.
You can make your application stand out by demonstrating that you have spent time on our website, <i>seen this message</i>, and thought hard about why our lab is a good fit for your skills and interests.</small>
<h3 class="fill-width">All Other Positions</h3>
We are completely full. Undergraduate students, please check back in January 2024 for Winter Quarter positions.

To be considered, you will need at least one publication 
in a high-quality international conference (computer science) 
or journal (neuroscience) 
and you need to have a reasonable chance of getting a fellowship
to support your stay at UCSB.
