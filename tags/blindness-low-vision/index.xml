      <title>Understanding the Information Needs of People Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to obtain a nuanced understanding of the strategies that people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) employ to perform different instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying useful and relevant visual cues that could support these iADLs, especially when the task involves some level of scene understanding, orientation, and mobility, will be essential to the success of near-future visual accessibility aids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simulating Visual Impairment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How are visual acuity and daily activities affected by visual impairment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies with people who have retinal degeneration have shown that vision is altered and impaired in the presence of a scotoma. This is also the case when a sighted person is tested under simulated low vision (SLV) conditions. However, the extent to which patient-specific factors affect vision and quality of life is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing sighted participants with SLV allows us to compare performance to real patients, design simulations to be as naturalistic as possible, and assess changes in vision for real life tasks instead of relying on acuity alone.&lt;/p&gt;
