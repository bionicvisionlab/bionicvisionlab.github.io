      <title>Understanding the Information Needs of People Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to obtain a nuanced understanding of the strategies that people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) employ to perform different instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying useful and relevant visual cues that could support these iADLs, especially when the task involves some level of scene understanding, orientation, and mobility, will be essential to the success of near-future visual accessibility aids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting Visual Outcomes for Visual Prostheses</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/predicting-visual-outcomes-visual-prostheses/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major outstanding challenge is predicting what people &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; when they use their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing focal spots of light, current visual implant users perceive highly distorted percepts, which vary in shape not just across subjects but also across electrodes and often fail to assemble into more complex percepts.
Furthermore, phosphenes appear fundamentally different depending on whether they are generated with retinal or cortical implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is thus to combine psychophysical and neuroanatomical data that can inform phosphene models capable of linking electrical stimulation directly to perception.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immersive Virtual Reality Simulations of Bionic Vision</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/immersive-virtual-reality-simulations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique requirements of working with bionic eye recipients (e.g., required assistance, increased setup time, travel cost), experimentation with different encoding methods remains challenging and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, embedding simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) models in immersive virtual reality (VR) allows sighted subjects to act as virtual patients by &amp;ldquo;seeing&amp;rdquo; through the eyes of the patient, taking into account their head and eye movements as they explore an immersive virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can speed up the development process by allowing us to test theoretical predictions in high-throughput experiments, the best of which can be validated and improved upon in an iterative process with the bionic eye recipient in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simulating Visual Impairment</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/simulated-visual-impairment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How are visual acuity and daily activities affected by visual impairment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies with people who have retinal degeneration have shown that vision is altered and impaired in the presence of a scotoma. This is also the case when a sighted person is tested under simulated low vision (SLV) conditions. However, the extent to which patient-specific factors affect vision and quality of life is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing sighted participants with SLV allows us to compare performance to real patients, design simulations to be as naturalistic as possible, and assess changes in vision for real life tasks instead of relying on acuity alone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visual Navigation Under High-Stress Conditions</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/high-stress-navigation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are known individual differences in both ability to learn the layout of novel environments and flexibility of strategies for navigating known environments.
It is unclear, however, how navigational abilities and situational awareness are impacted by high-stress scenarios and whether augmented reality (AR) could be employed to enhance performance and situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project will investigate three core questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does a person&amp;rsquo;s navigational abilities change in extreme situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we best train them for these situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can vision augmentation be employed to improve situational awareness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
