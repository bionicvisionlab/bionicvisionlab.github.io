      <title>Towards a Smart Bionic Eye</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than aiming to one day restore &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; vision (which may remain elusive until we fully understand the neural code of vision), we might be better off thinking about how to create &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; artificial vision now.
Specifically, a visual prosthesis has the potential to provide visual augmentations through the means of artificial intelligence (AI) based scene understanding (e.g., by highlighting important objects), tailored to specific real-world tasks that are known to affect the quality of life of people who are blind (e.g., face recognition, outdoor navigation, self-care).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, these visual augmentations could be combined with GPS to give directions, warn users of impending dangers in their immediate surroundings, or even extend the range of visible light with the use of an infrared sensor (think bionic night-time vision).
Once the quality of the generated artificial vision reaches a certain threshold, there are a lot of exciting avenues to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assistive Technologies for People Who Are Blind</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/assistive-technologies-blind/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Globally, millions of individuals with visual impairments face significant challenges in navigation and independence. Traditional white canes, while helpful, offer limited assistance in complex environments. Accessible tech, once effective, often turns commercial with hefty prices. This hits harder due to the high unemployment rate among the visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to leverage computer vision and AI to co-design the next-generation of accessible technologies with people who are blind, focusing on affordable design and open-source software, thereby enabling community-driven development and widespread impact.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visual Navigation Under High-Stress Conditions</title>
      <link>https://bionicvisionlab.org/research/high-stress-navigation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are known individual differences in both ability to learn the layout of novel environments and flexibility of strategies for navigating known environments.
It is unclear, however, how navigational abilities and situational awareness are impacted by high-stress scenarios and whether augmented reality (AR) could be employed to enhance performance and situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project will investigate three core questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does a person&amp;rsquo;s navigational abilities change in extreme situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we best train them for these situations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can vision augmentation be employed to improve situational awareness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
